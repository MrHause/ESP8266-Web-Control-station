# ESP8266-Web-Control-station
This project is a web application which uses WebSocket communication protocol to communicate with ESP8266 microcontroler. This application show how to use a different modules of the ESP microcontrolers and also how to create two-way communication between server and client using WebSocet protocol. In this project has been used following modules and sensors:
* DHT22
* Servomotor
* ADC
* LED
* PWM
User by the website can controll LED or servomotor like also check current temperature, humidity or ADC value which is controlled by potentiometer. Other used technologies:
* Ajax to create asynchronous communicatios to prevent automatic updated values of temperature, humidity and ADC
* WebSocket to handle connected users
* Http to send requests and responses betwen client and server
